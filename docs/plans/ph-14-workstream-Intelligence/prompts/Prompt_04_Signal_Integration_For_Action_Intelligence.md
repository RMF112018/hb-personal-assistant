# Prompt 04 — Signal Integration for Action Intelligence

You are operating in the local `RMF112018/hb-personal-assistant` repository. Follow repo truth. Do not invent files or APIs.

## Global Operating Rules for the Local Agent

- Work from repo truth only. Do not invent files, APIs, commands, schemas, or behavior.
- Do not re-read files that are still within your current context or memory. Only re-open files when you need to verify changed content, inspect lines not previously loaded, or confirm post-patch behavior.
- Before editing, capture the current repo state:
  - `git remote -v`
  - `git branch --show-current`
  - `git rev-parse HEAD`
  - `git log --oneline -20`
  - `git status --short`
- Keep every change Bobby-only and local-first.
- Do not add Microsoft 365 writeback.
- Do not add multi-user scope.
- Do not persist full email bodies.
- Do not persist full file contents.
- Do not move runtime state into cloud services.
- Do not classify delegated proof as a code failure if the live evidence shows tenant/admin consent is pending.
- Do not classify DNS as the active blocker unless current command evidence proves a live DNS failure.
- Prefer deterministic local fixtures and dry-runs while delegated Graph consent is pending.
- Preserve all existing user work. Do not delete unrelated untracked files or local artifacts.
- Commit after each prompt with the exact expected commit message unless repo truth requires a narrowly adjusted message.

## Objective

Derive action candidates from bounded body, parser, file, calendar, and retrieval signals.

## Likely Files / Modules Touched

actions, classification, retrieval, store, tests

## Required Work

1. Load bounded signals from existing store helpers: body mentions, parser outputs, calendar events, file review queue, and retrieval hits.
2. Map explicit action phrases to action types.
3. Implement confidence thresholds and monitor classification for weak signals.
4. Ensure all candidate titles/excerpts are redacted and bounded.
5. Add tests for direct action, review, approval, waiting-on, meeting prep, file review, and weak monitor signals.

## Validation Commands

pytest action signal tests; CLI dry-run against seeded fixture DB.

Use the relevant commands from the baseline as needed:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest
.venv/bin/ruff check .
mypy src
.venv/bin/hb-assistant diagnostics scan-sensitive --repo . --json
.venv/bin/hb-assistant run morning --dry-run --json
```

## Acceptance Criteria

The extractor produces useful source-linked candidates from local bounded signals.

## Evidence Requirements

Create or update a prompt-specific evidence folder under:

```text
docs/evidence/phase-14-local-runtime-workstream-intelligence/
```

Include:

- `summary.md`
- relevant command outputs or summarized exit codes;
- validation notes;
- blocker classification if applicable;
- final commit SHA.

## Expected Commit Message

```text
feat(actions): derive work items from bounded source signals
```
